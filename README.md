  - %c: Prints a single character
  - %s: Prints a string of characters.

  - %b: Priints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
  - %u: Prints unsigned integers
  - %x: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters
  - %X: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters
  - %:  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specfication is **%%**
